# Naive Bayes Classification (naive-bayes-classification)

## Purpose and Motivation
This project demonstrates training and evaluating a Naive Bayes classifier on a structured CSV dataset. It showcases an end-to-end supervised learning workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn. The goal is to illustrate clear, professional machine learning code suitable for real-world classification tasks.

## Features Demonstrated
- Loading structured CSV data with pandas
- Exploratory data inspection
- Train-test splitting with scikit-learn
- Gaussian Naive Bayes model training
- Accuracy scoring and classification report
- Modular, well-documented Python code

## Real-World Use Case
Naive Bayes classifiers are widely used for text classification, spam filtering, and other categorical prediction problems. This project demonstrates how to implement a complete Naive Bayes classification workflow in Python, with clean, reproducible, and well-documented code suitable for professional portfolios.
